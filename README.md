## Protea-causal-analysis
This repository contains an R notebook and associated files (including data)
used to illustrate how the Rubin causal model helps to understand what we
can (and can't) infer about causal relationships from observational data in
ecology and evolutionary biology. The data are drawn from Carlson et al.
(_Annals_ of Botany 117:195-207; 2016 (doi:
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcv146])).
